     Item Entity:
	- Makes sense to make items a weak entity of order as it can be considered a part of it.
	  However items also have an association with other entities as well so it may not necesarily be best to
	  label it as a weak entity. 
	- method makes it so items also needs additional attributes
	- weak entity is missing constraints
     Customer Entity:
	- not sure if separate customer entity is needed given the database specification as it suggests we
	  should keep track of each individual customer. 
     Review Entity:
	- Reviews are part of the order so it would make sense to label this as a "weak entity".
